# multitrack-audio-editor (Name in progress)

Here is a starting place for a multitrack audio recording and editing software by the RustyDAW project.

RustyDAW is a community-driven project. If you are interested in participating, feel free to join the [`RustAudio Discord`] server, you can find us in the channels `#rusty-daw` and `#rusty-daw-gui`.

## Objective

Why create a multitrack audio editor? Don't we want to create a DAW?

We want to limit the scope of our projects before we create the big stuff. A multitrack audio editor (like Audacity) is an excellent staring point to experiment and design our framework. With Rust's modularity, many parts can be reused for a full DAW project.
